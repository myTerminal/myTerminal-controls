;;; Install:

;; Put this file on your Emacs-Lisp load path and add the following to your
;; ~/.emacs startup file
;;
;;     (require 'myterminal-controls)
;;
;; Set a key-binding to open the quick-toggle controls window anytime
;;
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-M-`") 'myterminal-controls-open-controls)
;;
;; You can also set your custom list of quick-toggle controls
;;
;;     (myterminal-controls-set-controls-data
;;         (list '("1" "Invert colors"
;;                 (lambda ()
;;                   (invert-face 'default))
;;                 t)
;;               '("2" "Invert mode-line"
;;                 (lambda ()
;;                   (invert-face 'mode-line)))))
;;
;; Each item in the list should contain 3 to 4 elements:
;;
;; * Key combination information
;; * Text to be displayed in the controls window
;; * Function to be executed against the key combination
;; * [Optional] Whether the controls window should close after the command
;;

;;; Commentary:

;;     You can use myterminal-controls to save a lot of key-bindings by grouping
;;     them into a single controls window. The controls window can be opened
;;     with a key-binding and the rest key-bindings are displayed within the
;;     controls window.
;;
;;  Overview of features:
;;
;;     o   Saves key-bindings for simple toggle operations
;;     o   Groups a lot of toggles into a single window
;;
